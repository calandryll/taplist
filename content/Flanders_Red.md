summary: "Inspired by the classic Flemish Red Ale, Heiress de Bourgogne is a deeply complex sour red ale with notes of raisins, dark stone fruits, and a delicate tartness.

Utilizing the popular and unique kettle-souring method, Heiress will develop its tart, sour character in mere days instead of months or years without the risk of contaminating other batches. The resulting beer will mature rapidly into an elaborate menagerie of flavors, all bound within its deep ruby, medium-bodied elixir, and topped with a voluminous off-white head."
