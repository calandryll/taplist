title: 'Cali Pale Ale' # Name of beer
draft: false
summary: 'Our Cali Mountain Pale Ale is inspired by one of the most iconic pale ales in the country: Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale. This pale ale is a fairly simple recipe, consisting of 2-Row malt, Crystal 60L, and four hop additions.  This being said, don't be fooled.  The flavors blend together perfectly, creating a complex yet easy to drink homebrew.  The bittering hop additions are Magnum and Perle which provide a clean bitterness that balances the sweetness from the Crystal 60L malt perfectly.  The aroma hop and dry hop additions are both Cascade, providing a citrus & floral aroma as fresh as the forests in California's mountains!' # Description displayed below title
